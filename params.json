{"name":"My corner in cyberspace","tagline":"","body":"## whoam I?\r\n\r\nMy name is Sukil Etxenike. I am from Navarre (Spain), and I study English Studies in the University of the Basque Country.\r\n\r\n## What do I do?\r\n\r\nI might be considered tech-sabby or computer jeek, although I think the second definition is closer to reality. I sometimes enjoy programming small things in [Python,](http://python.org) although I consider myself a novice in that programming language. See [my repos](https://github.com/sukiletxe?tab=repositories) to see what I've done so far. \r\n\r\nI also like translating. Currently, I am the Basque translator of [TwBlue](https://github.com/manuelcortez/twblue). I speak Basque, Spanish and English.\r\n\r\nAs I am blind, I also care about accessibility with screen readers. I've filed several issues and contributed some code in various places. I think my greatest contribution was [An accessible version of the IPA chart in XHTML](https:/westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart). The original was by [Weston Ruter.](https://github.com/westonruter)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on [Twitter,](https://twitter.com/sukoiltxe) although I tweet mostly in Spanish. I may create a blog in the near future in github, too.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
